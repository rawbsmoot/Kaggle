      "Originally built in 1862, this extraordinary limestone building located in the heart of Tribeca is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece. With almost 30,000 sq. ft. of usable interior space, this is one of the largest and most beautiful properties to ever become available downtown. Built 41ft x 109ft with six floors above grade and two floors below grade, this property has been completely renovated both structurally and cosmetically to retain the structure's original character. The grand proportions of this building, with ceiling heights ranging from 12-25 feet, huge windows and multiple skylights bathe all areas with superb light. The classic elegance sets a tone with original cast iron columns, wide plank wood floors and exposed brick walls. Generous size bedrooms and bedrooms, huge closets, laundry room, hand crafted window shutters, Italian-made radiators and acoustic ceiling panels are featured throughout. New mechanical systems and a hi-speed elevator are in place, as well as top-of-the-line appliances, fixtures and hardware. The building features a triplex penthouse (approx. 11,000sqft) on the 4th, 5th and 6th floors with a landscaped roof deck, terrace and 4 bathrooms, a full floor two bedroom loft apartment with a large HO and 3 ÃÂ½ bath (approx. 4,000sqft) on 2nd floor, and two one bedroom loft apartments with HO and 2 full bathrooms (approx.2,100sqft and 1,900sqft). Additionally there is two levels of the gym/half basketball court in the basement for the tenant (approx. 2,650sqft). 144 Duane Street is on iconic cobblestone street that only historic Tribeca can offer. Live/Work is allowed.<br><p><img src= \" website_redacted width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><ul><li><a target=_blank href= website_redacted Marco Gobbo for more information</a> </li><li><a target=_blank href= website_redacted full listing information on elliman.com</a> </li></ul></p> \n",
